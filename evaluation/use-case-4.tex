An organization can acquire a marketing label by actively participating in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing. This label can enhance a company's reputation, demonstrating its proactive stance on security to customers and partners. For example, a CTI sharing platform might award a "Trusted Partner" label to organizations that regularly contribute to the community. This recognition serves as a marketable distinction, encouraging more organizations to participate in intelligence sharing to gain a competitive edge and build trust with stakeholders.
