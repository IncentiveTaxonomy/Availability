An organization publicly acknowledges and rewards employees who adhere to best cybersecurity practices and successfully prevent security incidents. For instance, an organization might implement a "Cybersecurity Champion" program, where employees are recognized and rewarded with a reputable certification during company meetings. This public acknowledgment boosts motivation and reinforces the importance of cybersecurity within the corporate culture.
