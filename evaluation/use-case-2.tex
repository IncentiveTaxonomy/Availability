An organization offers Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, which are popular in the cybersecurity community, to engage and train participants through simulated cyberattack scenarios. Participants from universities or cybersecurity firms compete to solve challenges and capture digital flags hidden in vulnerable systems. These competitions provide a dynamic and interactive learning environment, allowing individuals to hone their skills in a practical setting. By hosting or participating in CTF events, the organization can identify and foster talent, enhance teamwork, and encourage continuous learning in cybersecurity.
