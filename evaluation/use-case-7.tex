An organization sponsors their employees to obtain industry-recognized cybersecurity certifications such as CISSP, CISM, or CEH by covering the cost of training and exam fees. In detail, a financial institution pays for its security staff to earn these certifications, thereby enhancing their skills and boosting the organization's overall security expertise. This investment in professional development can improve individual capabilities and strengthen the company's defense against cyber threats.
